# Optimization Help

This screen shows **photovoltaic optimization** details.

We assume an energy balance of:

$$
E_{\\text{net}} = E_{\\text{prod}} - E_{\\text{cons}}
$$

Inline math also works, e.g. $P = U \\cdot I$.

## Notes

- Adjust the parameters on the left.
- The charts will update based on your configuration.
- The system size is given in kWp.
